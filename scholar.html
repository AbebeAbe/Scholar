    HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and 
more standardized version of HTML. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of features, 
such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.
in html:-we can close tags anytime and anywhere as our needs.
lewd structure is used.
we can add attribute without any quotes.
on the other hand in xhtml:- its mandatory to close all the tags in strict
residing order as they where declared.
It is mandatory to add quotes on every attribute we declare
It contains a very strict structure, and the developer cannot go out of the bounds of these structures.
Virsion of html
html 1.0
The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. 
 It does not have rich features like styling and other things thatwere related to how content will be
 rendered in a browser.
The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc. 
html 2.0
it is a non-proprietary format, openly documented specification and freely implementable.
HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of improving HTML version 1.0
html 3.2
It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next version of HTML was 3.2

html 4.01
It was developed in 1999. It extended the support of cascading styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded
 in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must
 place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.
To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 concept of an external styling sheet emerged. Under this concept, 
an external CSS file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself. 
HTML 4.01 provided support for further new tags of HTML
html 5
This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it could be used in 2014. It came up with lots o
 HTML tags support. HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input element s of different types;
 geolocations support tags, etc
